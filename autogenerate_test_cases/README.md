Ways to generate new testcases from given API schema and response-

1. Boundary Values Testing: testing API with inputs that are at boundary of allowed range, may be useful for identifying issues with input validation.
2. Random Testing: generating random inputs and testing over API, can explore unexpected behavior in API.
3. Combinational Testing: generating possible combinations of input parameters.
4. ML model: we can create a ML model for generating test cases.
